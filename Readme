# Notion API Python Sample

This sample demonstrates how to connect to Notion using the official Python client.

## Requirements

- Python 3.7 or higher
- notion-client (`pip install notion-client`)
- A Notion integration token. Create one at [Notion Integrations](https://www.notion.so/my-integrations).

## Setup

1. Install the Notion Python SDK:
   ```
   pip install notion-client
   ```

2. Obtain your Notion integration token from the Notion website.

3. Set your token as an environment variable:
   - On Linux/macOS:
     ```
     export NOTION_TOKEN=your_secret_token
     ```
   - On Windows:
     ```
     set NOTION_TOKEN=your_secret_token
     ```

4. Run the sample Python file. It will use the token to connect to Notion and list accessible databases.

## Usage

- The sample code initializes the Notion client and prints a list of databases your integration can access.
- You can modify the sample to create pages, update databases, or perform other operations using the Notion API.
